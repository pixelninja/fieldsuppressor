# Field Suppressor

* Version: 1.0
* Author: Phill Gray
* Build Date: 2011/08/12
* Requirements: Symphony 2.2

Allows individual fields to be hidden in each section

## Installation

- Upload the 'fieldsuppressor' folder to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.
- Enable it by selecting "Field Suppressor", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

## Usage

A checkbox will appear on all fields within the section editor. If you would prefer the client to not view certain fields, for example, ones which they might accidentally change (for instance Members: Password), then tick the box.

If the person signed into Symphony has the type 'Developer' they will see a toggle button in the entry edit page. If the person signed in is 'Author', then the option to toggle will not exist.
